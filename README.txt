This is the ADB - Group 8 Project repository. 

Note :  1) Always do a 'git pull origin master' or sync (if using GUI) before starting. That 
	   way merge conflicts will be avoided.
	2) Also after every changes do a  commit and sync so that your changes gets reflected 
           in the github repository.
	3) If using command line do 'git add <filename>' and then 'git commit -a -m "YOUR 
           COMMENTS HERE"' and then 'git push origin master'.
